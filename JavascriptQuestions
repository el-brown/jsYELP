var is older, let is more recent update.  
Let has block scope. (in an if statement etc) 
Var has function scope (it can still be called outside of the if statement if still in the function).
Var gets hoisted at the top of the function.  It exists before it's definition, it's just undefined.
Let exists from it's definition until the end of the block.

== is checking for loose equality.  Compares value only, not type.  1 == "1"  (true)
=== is checking for strict equality.  Compares both value and type. 1 === "1" (false)
