Talking about Styling and starting with Styled Components.
Highlights of Styled Components:
- Looks cleaner, easier to read
- You can pass properties like primary, border, inverted
- It creates a unique class name

I've already run:
yarn create react-app
yarn add styled-components 
yarn add react-router-dom for navigation

used App.js for routing and made some very basic components.

NAVBAR
Link because its a NAVBAR
Add Link but notice you can't see it
Style the background so you can see it MyNavBar
Style the Link now. 

STYLED COMPONENTS
Do all the components and then the buttons
