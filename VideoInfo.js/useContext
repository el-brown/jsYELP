useContext

React.createContext()

Context is broken into two different sections:

Context Provider - Wrap the code that needs the context. Everything inside the Provider
all have access to the variable(props) and can pass these props all the way down
to every child.  

In a Class Component:  Context Consumer - Wrap the code 

In a Functional Component: import useContext from React.  Pass in context to useContext
and then use it inside of whatever code you want.
const darkTheme = useContext(ThemeContext)
Gets rid of nesting and just use that one line of code ^
